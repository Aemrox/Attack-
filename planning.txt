Things I have left to write

Turn handling (calling the Clash class) - X
Creating Turn summary (and inputting into history) - X
Resolving Turn summary into altering the game state - X
Turn output - all the messaging that says who did what - X
Output State - to set the message for each turn - X
Game state instantiating a turn - X
Checks for Death and end of Game - X
Checks for exceeding the power available - X
The large runner that interacts with game state - halfway
Enemy AI

Then the debugging starts

Things I have to test:
Game State
  open_game - X
  new enemy - X
User
  initialize - X
  change stats - X
  regroup - X
Clash
  resolve - X
  maybe generating a turn summary happens in clash? - X
Turn
  evaluate move - X
  action list - X
  get_input - X


  Places I'd like to go in the future

  Saving characters - and keeping records of wins/losses
  Different monsters - create a new class that inherits from user, but takes new inputs on initialize
    - would allow me to build a more complex Yaml to determine different stats and tendencies
  Levels of difficulty based around an expanded AI and different monster_names
  Player V Player - which requires LAN or internet based connections between clients (much more advanced)
